Option 2: New Code - Create an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application
Your manager has received a request from the engineering department for a prototype of a new application that will provide IP addressing information to network technicians.

Search the internet for REST APIs that retrieve a user's current public IPv4 address and IPv6 address, such as ipapi.co or ipsstack.com. Using the public APIs, create a Python application that displays and formats the computer’s current public IP addressing information.

Depending on the API you select, you may also obtain geolocation information, the provider (ISP), the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the ISP, and country code.

Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.

Note: The objectives and specific tasks of your project will depend on the options provided by the IP information API you choose.

Rubric/Deliverable: The application that your team will work on and the reasons for your choice.

2. Team Roles
Now that you have selected your application project, you will begin to identify how each team member can contribute to the project. There may be some team members with more experience in certain areas than others. This can be an excellent opportunity for cross-training. Remember, in a successful team people are supportive, encouraging and willing to help other team members.

At this point, the Scrum Leader will facilitate the process of:

Identifying any persons on the team who may have knowledge, experience, or be an authority in a particular area or topic that is relevant to the project.
Developing a strategy to accomplish the tasks.
Creating a project plan to complete the tasks on schedule.
Identifying the tools needed to move forward.
Rubric/Deliverable: Document your team member roles, and any additional knowledge and skillsets that they can bring to this project.

3. Project Workload and Project Status
Discuss project workload and the team's time commitment. Team members have other responsibilities, and setting expectations can help avoid any future conflicts and help ensure completing the project on-time. Your manager will supply you with the amount of time that has been budgeted for your tasks.

Throughout this project, it will be important for the scrum leader to manage individual workloads and the status of each project. Many times, this role may be assigned to an individual who has expertise in this area and whose sole job is project management.

The scrum leader will need to facilitate the process of:

Maintaining a list of specific tasks.
Breaking down tasks into smaller tasks if possible.
Prioritizing each task.
Managing the status of each task and any effect it might have on the completion of other tasks and the project.
The scrum leader may assume the role of project manager, or have another team member perform these tasks. A simple cloud-based application such as Google Sheets or Google Docs may be used to for this purpose, allowing team members to continuously update the status of their individual tasks.

Rubric/Deliverable: Provide a brief description of your team’s strategy for completing this project.

4. Set Up GitHub for Collaboration
As mentioned previously, your manager has requested that your team use GitHub to collaboratively work on your Python code.

Using GitHub.com:

Create a repository
Add collaborators
Create branches for team members
Work with pull requests, code review, merge, etc.
Note: Your instructor may request that you link to the GitHub repository.

Rubric/Deliverable: Record the link to your GitHub repository. Describe how GitHub was used to create branches, add team members, do pull requests, etc.

5. Application Development
In this part of the Project Activity, the application will be completed. Continuously refer to the processes and tools discussed previously. Continue to review these questions:

Does the team continue to have open communications and positive attitudes?
Are team members encouraging and supporting each other?
Is the project being monitored with status updates of each task?
Are there any conflicts or workload issues?
Are the technical objectives achievable?
Your team is now ready to begin:

Coding specific tasks
Merging team code
Verifying that the code works (quality assurance)
In addition, the scrum leader has the responsibility to ensure that the team is:

Working collaboratively
Completing tasks on schedule
6. Final Presentation
Create a presentation about the project you selected and your work completing the project.

Deliverable/Rubric:. Your presentation should include:

Information about your application, covering what features your team included
The reasons that your team decided on these specific features in your application
Application code including comments and documentation. Your comments and documentation should be sufficient for any other team to be able to continue the project if required. Another team should be able to understand the application, your features and how to continue with the project.
Demonstration of the application
List of future enhancements (backlog)
Reflection points – what issues have you faced while working on this activity, how did you find solutions, what have you learned, etc.
Team Activities and Reflection
Deliverable/Rubric: Your manager is interested in knowing how everyone worked together as a team. Here is a list of questions from your manager:

What did you enjoy about working as a team? What worked well?
What team problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
What technical problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
How was each team member held accountable individually and for the team as a whole?
What was your team's decision-making process?
Overall, how were the team dynamics and what were any lessons learned?
Final Deliverables
At this point, your team has completed Project Activity 3. Your team will present to your manager:

Presentation
Team activities and reflection
Completed application code
Link to GitHub repository for your work
Completed rubric items
